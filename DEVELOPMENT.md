# Update steps

Follow [these](https://r-pkgs.org/Code.html#constant-health-checks) steps:

1. Run `library(devtools)` (optional?)
1. Edit one or more files below `R/`.
1. `devtools::document()`. Required if youâ€™ve made any changes that impact help files, NAMESPACE, or collate order. Note that `check()` won't update NAMESPACE so we need to run this. Also, it seems that sometimes you have to manually delete the NAMESPACE file so it will get recreated without errors.
1. `devtools::load_all()`
1. Run some examples interactively.
1. `devtools::test()` (or `test_active_file()`)
1. `devtools::check()`
1. `pkgdown::build_site()`. If you get the error "No package named fedplot" then you need to restart R beforehand (`ctrl+shift+F10`)


To see files available in extdata:

```R
system.file("extdata", package = "fedplot") |> list.files()

```
