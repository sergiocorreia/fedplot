# Update steps

Follow [these](https://r-pkgs.org/Code.html#constant-health-checks) steps:

1. Run `library(devtools)` (optional?)
1. Edit one or more files below `R/`.
1. `document()` (if youâ€™ve made any changes that impact help files, NAMESPACE, or collate order)
1. `load_all()`
1. Run some examples interactively.
1. `test()` (or `test_active_file()`)
1. `check()`



To see files available in extdata:

```R
system.file("extdata", package = "fedplot") |> list.files()

```
